# Org.asm

## Org is a Pong-like game that runs directly from the bootloader, without an operating system.

I got the idea of creating a game in the bootloader when I was working(incomplete) my [devOS project](https://github.com/varshneydevansh/devOS)
but in April 2024 I came across a playlist of [Tsoding on Twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/videos/441661946)
which inspired this gmae.

The reason I am making this is this is a long pending one and to actually prove I can come-up
with good naming's be it variables or project which is the toughest part of programming.
